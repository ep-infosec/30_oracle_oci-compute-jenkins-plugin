<div>
  Number of minutes for Jenkins to wait before deleting an idle slave, which means complete removal of created oracle compute cloud instance.<br/> 
  A value of 0 (or an empty string) indicates that idle slaves should never be stopped/deleted.<br/> 
  As an example, let's say a slave was started at 11:00 and Idle Termination Minutes was set 5.<br/> 
  The slave executed several Jenkins jobs from 11:00 to 11:20, and has been idle since then.<br/> 
  At 11:25 Jenkins finds the idle timeout of above slave has reached and the slave will be deleted.<br/>
