  Availability Domains are isolated from each other, fault tolerant, and very unlikely to fail simultaneously or be impacted by the failure of another Availability Domain. When you configure your cloud services, use multiple Availability Domains to ensure high availability and to protect against resource failure. Be aware that some resources must be created within the same Availability Domain, such as an instance and the storage volume attached to it.

  documentation for additional information.
