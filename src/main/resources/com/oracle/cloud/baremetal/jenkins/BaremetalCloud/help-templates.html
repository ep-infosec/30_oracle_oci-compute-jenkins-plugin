  The templates to use when creating instances in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 
  Compute. When Jenkins requests the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute plugin 
  to provision additional nodes for a label, the templates are searched for a match 
  based on the usage and labels configured in the template.  The first matching template
  is used to create and start instances in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute based 
  on the template configuration.

  See 
  <a href="https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm">Launching an Instance</a>
  documentation for additional information.
